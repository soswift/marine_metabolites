Marine Manuscript Figures

1) Map and Photos
1a Sat Map,1b elev map, 1c-K photos of sampled organisms
Status: DONE, small tweaks
TODO: get opinions, move around white space

2) Euler Plots
2a sample types, 2b macroalgae genera, 2c coral genera
Status: DONE, small tweaks
TODO: Uniform font with other figures

3) Metabolite Ordination
3a all samples by sample type, 3b corals ordination, 3c algae ordination
Status: RECODE (Sean) and refine
TODO: make all ordinations square and uniform font, drop outliers

4) Metabolite Heatmap
Significant metabolites highlighted by class and enrichment in sample types
Status: RECODE (Craig) based on updated metabolite selection
TODO: Decide on CLR transform and metabolite significance/abundance cutoff

5) Metabolite Networks
Networks showing significant association with sample type
Status: RECODE (Helena) based on updated metabolite selection
TODO: Decide on CLR transform and metabolite significance/abundance cutoff, write up new network descriptions

6) Microbe Ordination
6a all samples by sample type, 3b corals ordination, 3c algae ordination
Status: RECODE (Sean) and refine
TODO: make all ordinations square and uniform font, drop outliers

7) Microbe heatmap
Status: CODE
TODO: decide on CLR and Run random forest/LM on microbe data to determine sample type enrichment
